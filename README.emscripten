Astral can be built with Emscripten. The makefile Makefile.emscripten can build the demos
and library using the build system's Rules.mk to collect the demos and source files to
build. Emscripten builds, both the library .bc's and demo html pages, land in wasm.
Each of the demos can be run using "emrun wasm/demo_name-build.html". The demos accept
the majority of command line options as the native builds, support --help. In addition,
the files under demo_data are added to the web pages via Emscripten's "--preload-file"
option and thus one can use the files under demo_data to feed the demos as well.
